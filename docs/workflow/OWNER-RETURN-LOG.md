# Owner return log

One entry per return of the intent steward, newest last. Each entry: a dated
heading with the clock time of the return, then five one-sentence parts —
**Time away.** **Finished.** **Stuck.** **Needs you.** **Anything quietly
broken.** A fresh manager session reads the tail of this file first.

## 2026-09-06 14:03 - first wake: the idea arrived, nothing built yet

**Time away.** This is the first wake — no time away, no waves; the idea arrived
as a vision and four draft contracts and this session spent about ten minutes
reading them and the Amplifier substrate they must run on.

**Finished.** The project repository exists at `amplifier-memory/` with your
drafts imported unchanged (commit e19d4b9) plus the Converge kit — `PINS.md`, the
pre-push guard (`./.githooks/pre-push HEAD` prints "clean"), the workflow records,
a feedback inbox — and this session is registered and readable by the companion
app's own config loader (checked by running it: it lists `amplifier-memory`,
steward bkrabach).

**Stuck.** Nothing stopped; by design nothing was launched — no lane fills until
your word lands.

**Needs you.** Two calls: *ratify* the vision and contracts (my recommendation:
ratify `VISION`, `store.v1`, `session.v1`, `cli.v1` with the four edits E1–E4 in
`docs/workflow/FIRST-WAKE-REVIEW.md`, and hold `suggestions.v1` as a draft until
Phase 1's gate), and *irreversible*: create `github.com/bkrabach/amplifier-memory`
— say **public**, **private**, or **hold**.

**Anything quietly broken.** Two things you did not ask about: your predecessor
`amplifier-engram` is still injecting into every session through the
`anchors-amp-dev` bundle while its store on this device does not exist, so
installing this bundle beside it means two memory blocks per request until one
is removed; and to make this session visible in the app I added a `workspaces`
list to `~/.amplifier/converge-app.toml` (backup at
`converge-app.toml.bak-2026-09-06`) — I could not confirm it renders on Home
because Home requires sign-in.

<details><summary>Technical detail</summary>

- Substrate findings that shaped the review: `session:start` hook results are
  discarded by the kernel; `context:post_compact` is never emitted; injection
  is `provider:request` + ephemeral. Slash commands from a bundle are
  user-invocable skills (`$ARGUMENTS`). Sub-agent detection is
  `coordinator.parent_id`. Evidence pointers in `PINS.md`.
- Where to watch: http://127.0.0.1:8788 (sign in with the machine account).
- Plan record: `.converge/amplifier-memory/PLAN.md` at the workspace root.

## 2026-09-06 14:21 - back with direction: name it amplifier-bundle-memory, lib-first with a thin click CLI, engram is going away

**Time away.** About eighteen minutes since the first brief; no waves ran, none
could — the lock word has not landed.

**Finished.** Your direction is applied and committed (`15340c1`): the repository
and bundle are `amplifier-bundle-memory` with the `amplifier-memory` CLI inside;
cli.v1 gained Core §9 (*the CLI is a thin click wrapper; every behaviour is a
public library function the tool, hook and Phase 2 job call directly*) and
AGENTS.md gained rule 11 saying the same for every surface; the four draft edits
E1–E4 are in the drafts; the pre-push scan on the result printed "clean"; and the
manager is re-registered under the new name (the app's loader lists it).

**Stuck.** Nothing stopped; the wave-1 lane briefs are drafted in the batch
directory so launch is immediate on your word.

**Needs you.** Two words: *ratified* (or *ratified with edits* / *later*) for
`VISION`, `store.v1`, `session.v1`, `cli.v1` as now drafted, with
`suggestions.v1` held as a draft unless you say otherwise; and for
`github.com/bkrabach/amplifier-bundle-memory` — **public**, **private**, or
**hold**.

**Anything quietly broken.** Nothing new; the engram overlap I flagged last time
is struck from the concerns list on your word, and the `converge-app.toml` edit
from the first wake still stands with its backup beside it.

## 2026-09-06 14:28 - the word: ratified, private
